# About [**Wei Ma**, Ph.D.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZubTNs0AAAAJ&hl=en)

Currently, I am a research scientist at Singapore Management University (SMU). I have published over 20 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including ICSE, ISSTA, ASE, TOSEM, and EMSE. During my Ph.D. studies at University of Luxembourg, my research focused on enhancing the efficiency and practicality of mutation testing, through a systematic investigation of its fundamental theories and enabling techniques, working closely with [Prof. Yves Le Traon](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=DmGlmNEAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=14102473421921925766) and [Prof. Mike Papadakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4O3EolUAAAAJ&hl=el&inst=14102473421921925766). In my postdoctoral work, I broadened my research scope to encompass interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of software testing and intelligent system security, resulting in a diversified and forward-looking research portfolio. At SMU, I work with [Prof. Lingxiao Jiang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=0hssXLPZL2YC&hl=en&inst=14102473421921925766), and during my time at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, I collaborated with [Prof. Yang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=_Pvgwd0AAAAJ&hl=en&inst=14102473421921925766) and [Prof. Yi Li](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=B61QIUIAAAAJ). I served as a reviewer for top conferences and journals, including ISSTA, TOSEM, ASE NIER, JSS, JSA, KNOSYS, and EMSE.

## **Dynamic Testing**

> My research in dynamic testing focuses on enhancing the efficiency and practicality of mutation testing and fuzz testing methodologies. I develop novel approaches for commit-aware mutation testing, delta-oriented testing strategies, and intelligent fuzz driver generation to improve software quality assurance processes.
