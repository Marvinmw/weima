# About Me

I have published over 20 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including ICSE, ISSTA, ASE, TOSEM, and EMSE. During my Ph.D. studies, my research focused on enhancing the efficiency and practicality of mutation testing, through a systematic investigation of its fundamental theories and enabling techniques, working closely with [Prof. Yves Le Traon](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=DmGlmNEAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=14102473421921925766) and [Prof. Mike Papadakis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4O3EolUAAAAJ&hl=el&inst=14102473421921925766). In my postdoctoral work, I broadened my research scope to encompass interdisciplinary topics at the intersection of software testing and intelligent system security, resulting in a diversified and forward-looking research portfolio. At SMU, I work with [Prof. Lingxiao Jiang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=0hssXLPZL2YC&hl=en&inst=14102473421921925766), and during my time at NTU, I collaborated with [Prof. Yang Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=_Pvgwd0AAAAJ&hl=en&inst=14102473421921925766) and [Prof. Yi Li](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=B61QIUIAAAAJ).
